      <h2 class="page-heading">About ABC Cares</h2>
      <p>ABC members have for years given back to their communities in enormous ways.
         Whether through the annual ABC Handlebars for the Holidays event, golf and fishing tournaments (which benefited local charities),
         or its partnership with the American Red Cross, we have helped make our world a better place to live.
         But when one of our own was in need and we didn’t have a conduit to help them directly, it made us jump to action.
         So the ABC Cares Foundation was formed. And since being granted it’s IRS 501c(3) status in late 2010,
         the ABC Cares Foundation has made a big impact.</p>

       <li>The surviving spouse of a construction professional who suffered a fatal industrial accident. </li>
