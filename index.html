      <h2 class="page-heading">About ABC Cares</h2>
      <p>ABC members have for years given back to their communities in enormous ways.
         Whether through the annual ABC Handlebars for the Holidays event, golf and fishing tournaments (which benefited local charities),
         or its partnership with the American Red Cross, we have helped make our world a better place to live.
         But when one of our own was in need and we didn’t have a conduit to help them directly, it made us jump to action.
         So the ABC Cares Foundation was formed. And since being granted it’s IRS 501c(3) status in late 2010,
         the ABC Cares Foundation has made a big impact.</p>

      <h2 class="page-heading">Who We've Helped</h2>
      <p>In less than seven years, ABC Cares has donated more than $60,000 to construction professionals and their families, including:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>A life-long construction professional who needed help to participate in an out-of-state clinical trial for pancreatic cancer.</li>
       <li>A long-time champion of ABC’s charitable fishing tournaments who was financially devastated by his fight with cancer.</li>
       <li>A career industry professional who suffered a severe and debilitating heart attack. </li>
       <li>The surviving spouse of a construction professional who suffered a fatal industrial accident. </li>
       <li>A drywall craftsman, and his daughters, whose sudden loss of their mother left the entire family with inimitable needs. </li>
     </ul>
     <p>And many others.</p>
